Welcome to AUTOHIAM's documentation!
===================================

**AUTOHIAM** (/ˈɔː.toʊ.haɪ.æm/) is an affordable and flexible vision-based robotic system that automates Hydrogel Infusion Additive Manufacturing (HIAM) Gen2&3. It's open-source,
chemist-friendly, and can be easily adapted to other HIAM-like chemical processes without extensive programming.

AUTOHIAM enables chemists to carry out HIAM Gen2/Gen3 experiments with any number of samples and cycles—day or night—without manual intervention or programming skills. Chemists
are advised to remotely control the PC and the robot via Teamviewer and monitor the experiments via a surveillance camera.

.. It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
.. and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
